# CNCF Landscape Graph

:warning: Initial, open, active development. :warning:  

_Roadmap planning in-process._

Join us @ [#landscape-graph][lg-slack]. Here's our [current activities][lg-plan]. Formal plan and [roadmap](https://github.com/cncf/landscape-graph/issues/46) are in progress.

In November of 2018 there were 25 CNCF projects.

At the time [Ayrat Khayretdinov][archyufa] published the "[Beginner's Guide to the CNCF Landscape][guide]." It opened with:

[guide]: https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/11/05/beginners-guide-cncf-landscape

> The cloud native landscape can be complicated and confusing. Its myriad of **open source projects are supported by the constant contributions of a vibrant and expansive community.** The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has a landscape map that shows the full extent of cloud native solutions, many of which are under their umbrella.

It described the CNCF Mission in these terms:

> The CNCF fosters this landscape of open source projects by **helping provide end-user communities with viable options for building cloud native applications.** By encouraging projects to collaborate with each other, the CNCF hopes to enable fully-fledged technology stacks comprised solely of CNCF member projects. **This is one way that organizations can own their destinies in the cloud.**

## We.  Have.  Grown.

<!-- TODO: source the report -->
Today there are 5.4 million humans using Kubernetes and the landscape continues to expand.

| 2022 Q2   | Cards | :star:    | cap      | funding |
| --------- | ----- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| projects  | 111   | 614,394   | $291.4 M | $29.6 M |
| ecosystem | 1,061 | 3,066,372 | $15.7 T  | $29.1 B |

## We have a "good" problem

The [CNCF Landscape][landscape] aggregates summary data from GitHub, Crunchbase, Yahoo Finance, Twitter, and other sources while providing the ability quickly find, filter, and group the more than 1000 Cards across numerous dimensions.  It is automagically updated daily. It continues to work as designed.

With a single well placed click a wealth of data can be summoned. 

Here's the "Card" for [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com)

This is perfect when we know what we're looking for (specifically).

Often, we need to understand how a project interacts with others, how it's changing over time, and who's enabling it's continued success. We want to understand what alternatives exist, or how complementary projects might be combined in purpose-fit or novel ways. This is how projects and ecosystems grow to meet the business challenges that face modern organizations irrespective of domain.

Graphs can facilitate rich analysis of our vibrant and dynamic communities, the humans they comprise, and clusters of contribution and thought leadership they produce.

## How can a graph help us?

Current [Quests and Questions][quest].  Please [add your own][GQ]; they are the reason for this!

[quest]: https://github.com/orgs/cncf/projects/7/views/5
[GQ]: https://github.com/cncf/landscape-graph/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Q+for+graph&template=question-for-graph.md&title=I+want+to+...+so+that+I+can+...

### Questions

* for a set of projects, for all repos by release, show package dependency trees, overlaid with current CVE announcements w/ reporting and alerting as necessary.

* for a set of projects' contributors, who employed them whilst they contributed? Who funded those organizations? Who owns them? What else did they invest in?

* How does investment flow through the Landscape? Who maintains what? Who uses it?

* Identify communities. Understand how they interact. Comprehend how they collaborate with each other.

* Grok groupings of frequent code review <-> author interactions across projects.

* Facilitate generation of Dora metrics in-rears from historical GitHub data for all CNCF projects. ([more on DORA](https://medium.com/@halcyondude/on-measuring-developer-productivity-9a81a50175da)).

* Are popularity and market cap correlated?

* What companies are using which projects? What vendors support that?

* What happened in Twitter last week related to my project?

## Technical TLDR

### GRANDstack (<https://grandstack.io>)

_source: [grandstack.io/docs/...](https://grandstack.io/docs/getting-started-neo4j-graphql)_

GRANDstack is a combination of technologies that work together to enable developers to build data intensive full stack applications. The components of GRANDstack are:

* **G**raphQL -  A new paradigm for building APIs, GraphQL is a way of describing data and enabling clients to query it.
* **R**eact   -  A JavaScript library for building component based reusable user interfaces.
* **A**pollo  -  A suite of tools that work together to create great GraphQL workflows.
* **N**eo4j **D**atabase - The native graph database that allows you to model, store, and query your data the same way you think about it: as a graph.

Here's how it all fits together in the context of a movie search app:

## Landscape Graph Data Model

Using the [data][seeddata] underlying the existing landscape as input, a Labeled Property Graph ([LPG][lpg]) is constructed using [Cypher][ocypher] (SQL for Graphs), resulting in a [Neo4j][neo] graph database.

## Graph Data Science Algorithms ("Why Neo4j?")

<https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-data-science/graph-algorithms>

Graph Databases “perform the join on insert” instead of query time. No joins or table scans required.

A graph data model (vs. rectangular relational) can bring to bear all
that we’ve learned from ad/fin/security tech, big data, ml, etc.

### Cypher ("SQL for Graphs")

<https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher>

> Cypher is a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient querying, updating and administering of the graph. It is designed to be suitable for both developers and operations professionals. Cypher is designed to be simple, yet powerful; highly complicated database queries can be easily expressed, enabling you to focus on your domain, instead of getting lost in database access.

On its influences and roots:

> Cypher is inspired by a number of different approaches and builds on established practices for expressive querying. Many of the keywords, such as WHERE and ORDER BY, are inspired by SQL. Pattern matching borrows expression approaches from SPARQL. Some of the list semantics are borrowed from languages such as Haskell and Python. Cypher’s constructs, based on English prose and neat iconography, make queries easy, both to write and to read.
