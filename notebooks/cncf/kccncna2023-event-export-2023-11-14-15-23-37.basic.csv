These are qualities we look for when establishing our infrastructure to support Kubernetes and even building the workloads we run atop. However, Nix certainly has its trade-offs. For one, the function-style language (nix) may feel foreign to many in the Go-dominated, cloud-native, ecosystem. Additionally, Nix has unconventional opinions around packages themselves, along with host details, such as the existence of /bin, /lib, etc. Today, we will explore the potential relationship between the Kubernetes ecosystem and Nix.

Pod scheduling is one of the trickiest parts of Kubernetes infrastructure to get right. Done correctly, it can have enormous benefits in terms of cost and efficiency; done poorly, it can cause outages or lasting damage to your bottom line. The Kubernetes scheduler comes with a host of parameters that you can tune to control its behaviour, as well as allowing users to inject custom plugins at almost every stage of the scheduling process. In a large-scale cluster, the interactions between all these knobs can lead to unexpected emergent behaviour that is nearly impossible to reason about. To simulate this, we use a virtual kubelet that presents itself as a fully-configurable, low-overhead Kubernetes node object. In this presentation we show how to use this technique to collect data about scheduling decisions that are made for a variety of different kube-scheduler parameters.",David Morrison,Intermediate,In-Person,Yes,W175 (Ground Level)

This is caused by the different requirements around the way that VMs are started and migrated, which doesn’t match up with way we handle these things in the Kubernetes world. Outside of Kubernetes, existing legacy hypervisor solutions require VMs to be shutdown before migration, resulting in significant downtime. Even if they support live migration, that process is usually slow, error-prone, requires extensive preparation, and cuts networking during migration. These challenges make it difficult for legacy, stateful applications to leverage Kubernetes. This talk will dive into how we use r3map to solve these issues by providing stateful applications with the same UX that developers expect from containers by speeding up migrations, enabling persistent network connections, and guaranteeing zero downtime.",Felicitas Pojtinger,Advanced,In-Person,Yes,W184 (Ground Level)

It is common for pipelines to build and push images to the cluster, but uncommon for those images to be removed from a node’s local store once a CVE has been disclosed. Kubernetes has no built-in solution to this problem: its garbage collection only responds to disk pressure. As images become outdated, they present a risk as users may run a vulnerable container. Eraser, a CNCF sandbox project, is an open source solution that automates the scanning and removal of images. What distinguishes Eraser is that it gives more control over removal: the developer decides what gets removed and when. By default, Eraser uses Trivy to scan images based on a given threshold of vulnerability. Images can also be removed based on custom logic.

Even a single controller contains a diverse range of configuration parameters that introduces the opportunities for mistakes, and moreover multiple controllers can interact badly with each other and with environmental events due to shared dependencies. For example, pods can fail to be created even though resources are enough, or can oscillate in an unending cycle of scheduling and eviction. This talk first presents a collection of pathological and unintended issues arising from controllers. Then it discusses Kivi, a prototype project that verifies correctness of Kubernetes clusters to help users detect issues before they apply changes. Kivi leverages model checking techniques that can either assure desired properties will be preserved, or generate minimal examples demonstrating violations.

However, using such models come at a steep computational cost and is a major barrier to entry for many businesses and researchers. This talk proposes a novel approach to improve LLM efficiency, for complex reasoning tasks, by composing containerized LLMs as an inference decision tree called Tree Of Thoughts (ToT) and orchestrating it using various K8S ecosystem projects. ToT is an inference framework in combinatorial problem space, where each node represents a specific train of thought. This approach improves inference efficiency by refining prompts from the initial inputs through ‘conversations’ between models. All this sounds abstract, so using CNCF projects such as Operator Framework, Redis, Neo4j, and KEDA you will learn how to build a concrete ToT implementation.

Don&rsquo;t worry - you aren&rsquo;t alone. While their extensive set of features and configurations makes service meshes adaptable to various cloud environments, they can also be overwhelming to operators primarily interested in their core use-cases. Unrestricted access to all these capabilities (particularly experimental or alpha status ones) can also be ill-suited for production environments. Switching meshes or going sidecar-less could work, but aren&rsquo;t always feasible options. In this session, you&rsquo;ll learn some useful techniques - such as using Kubernetes admission controllers, feature flags, API abstractions, and GitOps tools - for feature-gating your service mesh and narrowing the configuration surface area. You&rsquo;ll also walk away with some guidelines for deciding which networking, security, and observability capabilities to include in, or exclude from, your mesh environments, based on examples from Istio and Open Service Mesh.

Any data protected using classical encryption-–including private messages, banking details, confidential business information–-is at risk of falling into the wrong hands as quantum computers become more powerful. To protect against this threat, the cybersecurity community has created a suite of new quantum-safe encryption which the NIST has chosen as part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard. So, how do we adopt these tools and standards in Kubernetes? In this talk, Paul and Max will sketch the steps to safeguard Kubernetes against attacks on classical encryption using quantum-safe technologies.
